    What is a sprint?
  </h1>
   <h2 align="center">By Jacob Andal</h2>
  <p align="center">
    A sprint is a short race, usually competed in by 9 runners at a time. The sprints races are generally considered to be the <strong>100m, 200m</strong> and <strong>400m</strong> races. 800m-3200m are considered middle distances, and any interval above that is considered a long distance race.

    100m
  </h3>
  <p>
    The 100 meter race is the shortest sprint in the Athletics lineup, characterized by explosive power and top-end speed.

    A 100 meter race begins with a block start. When the starter calls "on your marks", all runners take their positions on the blocks: feet on the blocks, hands on the line, and one knee down. "Set." All runners raise their grounded knee, pointing their shins towards their shoulders. When the starting pistol fires, every runner takes off, propelling themselves forward and swinging their arms in tandem.

    The 100m is the shortest of all the Track and Field races, lasting less than 10 seconds at the elite level. Runners usually reach their max speed at the 60-70 meter mark. After this mark, runners slow down slightly. This is because the body's ATP system is exhausted, and energy starts to run dry. Because of the race's short nature and emphasis on maximum velocity, its winner (in the Olympics) is often crowned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression" target="_blank"> Fastest in the World</a>.
  </p>

  <h5> 200m </h5>
  <p> The 200 meter race is often grouped together with the 100m. They operate on the same principles, focusing on absolute power and fine-tuned technique. Oftentimes, runners who focus on the 100m will run the 200m as a secondary race. However, the next interval of sprint races, the 400m, is a vastly different frontier.</p>

  <p>The 400m race's defining feature is its simplicity: a full revolution around a track. However, its defining difference from the shorter 100m and 200m races is its length. It's not a distance race; it's over in less than a minute. It's not a sprint either; it's too long to be a quantifier of top speed. It's something in the middle, formally known as a 'long sprint', a blend of speed and endurance. This deadly combination requires a delicate balance, leading many to consider the 400m race as the <strong>hardest event in track and field</strong>.</p>
