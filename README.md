    What is a sprint?
  </h1>
   <h2 align="center">By Jacob Andal</h2>
  <p align="center">
    A sprint is a short race, usually competed in by 9 runners at a time. The sprints races are generally considered to be the <strong>100m, 200m</strong> and <strong>400m</strong> races. 800m-3200m are considered middle distances, and any interval above that is considered a long distance race.
  </p>
 
  <h3>
    100m
  </h3>
  <p>
    The 100 meter race is the shortest sprint in the Athletics lineup, characterized by explosive power and top-end speed.

    A 100 meter race begins with a block start. When the starter calls "on your marks", all runners take their positions on the blocks: feet on the blocks, hands on the line, and one knee down. "Set." All runners raise their grounded knee, pointing their shins towards their shoulders. When the starting pistol fires, every runner takes off, propelling themselves forward and swinging their arms in tandem.

  <h5>The Run</h5>

    The 100m is the shortest of all the Track and Field races, lasting less than 10 seconds at the elite level. Runners usually reach their max speed at the 60-70 meter mark. After this mark, runners slow down slightly. This is because the body's ATP system is exhausted, and energy starts to run dry. Because of the race's short nature and emphasis on maximum velocity, its winner (in the Olympics) is often crowned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression" target="_blank"> Fastest in the World</a>.
  </p>

  <h5> 200m </h5>
  <p> The 200 meter race is often grouped together with the 100m. They operate on the same principles, focusing on absolute power and fine-tuned technique. Oftentimes, runners who focus on the 100m will run the 200m as a secondary race. However, the next interval of sprint races, the 400m, is a vastly different frontier.</p>

  <p>The 400m race's defining feature is its simplicity: a full revolution around a track. However, its defining difference from the shorter 100m and 200m races is its length. It's not a distance race; it's over in less than a minute. It's not a sprint either; it's too long to be a quantifier of top speed. It's something in the middle, formally known as a 'long sprint', a blend of speed and endurance. This deadly combination requires a delicate balance, leading many to consider the 400m race as the <strong>hardest event in track and field</strong>.</p>
  <h5>The Start</h5>
  <p>
    This phase covers the first 0-50 meters of the race. Like the 100m and 200m, the 400m race begins with a block start. However, there are two different philosophies to the strategy of a start.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The most common strategy is to 'attack' the start and explode from the blocks. This idea is rooted in the fact that the body's most powerful energy system, ATP, runs out after the first 6-7 seconds of intense effort. While not wrong, this strategy is shut down by physics: because of inertia, an object at rest will want to stay at rest. Accelerating from a standstill to high speeds in the span of a few seconds burns too much energy.</li>

    <li>In complete opposite from the first strategy, the idea of this one is to be energy-efficient and accelerate as smoothly as possible. This has the effect of bringing the runner up to speed relatively quickly, while conserving energy for the end of the race.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>The Glide</h5>
    <p>Covering the 50-200 meters of the 400m is the Glide. Compared to the other phases, this one is unremarkable. The general strategy is to keep your arms low and your stride short to conserve energy, while maintaing the speed you accelerated to after the start.</p>
  <h5>The Curve</h5>
    <p>Covering the 200-300 meters is the back curve. This phase is characterized by its buildup to the final stretch; after a straightaway of gliding, your goal on the curve is to slowly put more effort and speed into each step. The arms become useful here, as using wide swings can help you maintain speed and build up force.</p>
  <h5>Hell on Earth</h5>
  <p>The final 100 meters of the 400m is widely accepted as the worst pain a runner can feel. Because ATP ran out way back at the start, the body relies on anaerobic methods to produce energy, which produces lactic acid as a byproduct. This substance burns your muscles and makes each step heavier than the last, both figuratively and literally. This point in the races marks the point where it's no longer a physical battle for victory, but a mental battle to survive until the end.</p>
